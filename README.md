A project for my computer science class that assigned points to riders competing in the ElliptiGO GOGO challenges for March, April, and May. This app reads each rider's ride data and applys the challenge point value in a UI that makes it easy for the rider to track progress in each monthly challenge. A rider enters their ID number to retrieve their progress.

HOW TO USE:

Enter a id number to see rider GOGO challenge data/progress from the March, April, and May 2022 challenges outlined here: http://elliptigoclub.org/get-out-and-go/

Use ID 5, 25, or 33 for real user examples
